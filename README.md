# Geofence

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a geofence using a Raspberry Pi Pico W and NEO-6M/NEO-M8N GPS modules. The repository contains the source codes and the project has been deployed on Vercel.

## Description

I worked on implementing a geofence system using the following components:
- **Raspberry Pi Pico W**
- **NEO-6M GPS Module**
- **NEO-M8N GPS Module**

The project is designed to monitor the geographical boundaries and trigger alerts when the monitored entity moves outside the predefined area.

## Deployment

You can access the deployed project via the following links:
- [Geofence Project on Vercel](https://geofence-two.vercel.app/)
- [Geofence Pico on Vercel](https://geofencepico.vercel.app/)

## Repository Contents

- Source codes for the geofence implementation
- Configuration files for the GPS modules

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` to set up your Raspberry Pi Pico WH and GPS modules.
3. Run the provided scripts to start monitoring the geofence.
